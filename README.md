# SimplePasswordGen

A simple terminal-based password generator that allows the user to select which character types to include (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, punctuation) and generates a random password based on those preferences.

---

## üìå Features

- Interactive CLI menu
- User input validation
- Customizable character pool
- Error handling for invalid inputs and empty character pools
- Formatted terminal output for enhanced readability

## üß† How It Works

The program asks the user:

1. Whether to begin the password generation process.
2. Desired password length.
3. Whether to include:
   - Uppercase letters
   - Lowercase letters
   - Numbers
   - Punctuation symbols

If all character types are deselected, the program warns the user before proceeding.
